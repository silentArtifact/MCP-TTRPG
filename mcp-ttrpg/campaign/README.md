# Campaign Memory

All campaign notes are stored as Markdown files with YAML front matter.

## Folders

- `sessions/` – session notes named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `lore/` – lore entries named `{slug}.md`

## Front Matter Template

```
---
title: Session TITLE OR LORE TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: []
---

# Heading

Session or lore details...
```

Create new files following these conventions so the MCP server can read and write them.
